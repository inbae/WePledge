<p>Your <strong>$${1}</strong> to <strong> ${2}</strong>. The images and news reports of the drought crisis are hard to take in, and the challenges may seem overwhelming. But together, we can make an impact in drought relief. Free The Children is providing extra support to our drought-stricken communities in Kenya through feeding programs for children and mothers, as well as partnering with UNHCR to bring emergency supplies to Somali refugees in Dadaab, Kenya. As always, this response is being paired with ongoing sustainable development projects, to help strengthen these communities in the face of future droughts. We invite you to join us in bringing short- and long-term drought relief to East Africa, through your very own Free The Children campaign.</p>
